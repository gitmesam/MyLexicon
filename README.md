# MyLexicon
My English vocabulary. The most honest self-test of vocabulary

# How do I add words to my vocabulary?
Those words that I really know - I add. Word forms, ethnonyms, toponyms, chemical and biological terms are minimized or absent in the dictionary.

Words starting with `de`, `di`, `dis` are generally excluded as well as many other word forms.
